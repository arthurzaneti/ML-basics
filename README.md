Learning the basics of Machine Learning

This entire project is based on the course "Machine Learning for everybody" from freecodecamp.org.
It is REALLY simple, I pretty much just followed the class but still it is so nice seeing Machine Learning in action.
Huge thanks to freecodecamp, the link for the video I followed is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_LwzRVP7bg
